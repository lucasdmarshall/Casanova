Same Toolset as the MCP server, so the two cannot drift apart in behaviour.

SECURITY: this service drives the Docker daemon, which is root-equivalent on the
host. Treat the service itself as privileged — bind it to loopback and put your
own auth in front. Never expose it to an untrusted network. The *executed code*
is sandboxed; the *service* is not.
