"""HTTP front end.

    uvicorn hiraraweb.service:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Same Toolset as the MCP server, so the two cannot drift apart in behaviour.

Bind this to localhost or keep it behind your own auth. It is an egress
primitive: anyone who can reach it can make your server issue requests, and
while :mod:`hiraraweb.guard` stops those requests reaching your internal
network, an open instance is still someone else's free proxy.
