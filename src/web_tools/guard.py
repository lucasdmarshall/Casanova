"""SSRF perimeter.

The threat model: the URL is attacker-influenced. The model picked it off a
search result page, out of a fetched document, or straight out of a prompt.
Any of those can be authored by someone who wants our egress.

Two rules make this safe, and both are load-bearing:

1. Resolve the hostname ourselves and reject if *any* returned address is
   non-global. Rejecting only the first address lets a resolver hand back one
   good IP and one bad one and gamble on which the client picks.
2. Connect to the exact IP we validated, carrying the original hostname in the
   ``Host`` header and in SNI. Validating a name and then letting the HTTP
   client resolve it again is a DNS-rebinding hole: the second lookup can
   return a different answer than the one we approved.

Callers must run every redirect hop back through :func:`resolve_target`.
